    UX Aspects can be downloaded via the Bower package manager, allowing it to be added to your build process and work with your existing tooling.
    The steps below describe a set of tools you can use to download the UX Aspects package; these are development dependencies only, your application
    will not require these in production. If you donâ€™t need an automated install process, you can instead direct download the zip files further down this page.
